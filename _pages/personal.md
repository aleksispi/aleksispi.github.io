This page contains more personal content, reflections and ideas. Please see the [main page](https://aleksispi.github.io) for my professional bio.

I enjoy spending time with my family (wife, 6-year-old, and cairn terrier Yoshi). Some hobbies and interests I've had over the years include board gaming (2013 and onwards), [collapsology](https://www.collapsologie.fr/en/) (2018 and onwards), and vegetable cultivation at our ground-level apartment (2020 and onwards). I've been [collapse aware](https://www.the-sentinel-intelligence.net/10-reasons-our-civilization-will-soon-collapse/) since the spring of 2020 and am deeply worried about the [multiple interlocking crises that our societies face](https://www.postcarbon.org/publications/welcome-to-the-great-unraveling/), and our responses to these crises, which I hope to write more about here in the future. I also intend to write down / summarize ideas on the topic of [individual and community resilience](https://aleksispi.github.io/resilience). 

In the picture below, some of the interests mentioned above can be seen and/or derived. The tomatoes were grown in our small garden, and it seems our dog Yoshi is trying to sniff the box containing the tomatoes. Yoshi weighs a bit over 10 kgs, and thus (small as he may be), [he represents more than 4x the land-based wildlife mammal weight per human](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2023-08-21/ecological-cliff-edge/). _In other words, if we took all land-based wildlife mammals out there in the world, and shared them equally among us 8 billion humans, it would mean we get 2.5 kgs (or 1/4 of our dog Yoshi) each._

The following is a sentence I came up with some while ago, which I think resonates quite well with the above: **_The elephant in the room is that there are too many elephants in the room, one of which is that there are no elephants in the room._**
