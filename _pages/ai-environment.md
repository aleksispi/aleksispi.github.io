This page contains information about projects, publications and other things that relate specifically to my research on ML systems for various environmental applications (both regarding mitigation of further environmental harm, as well as adaptation with respect to existing or locked in harm). It is thus in a sense a subset of my full professional bio which can be found on the [main page](https://aleksispi.github.io).
