**Short version:** _Senior ML researcher at [RISE](https://www.ri.se/en) -- Co-founder of [Climate AI Nordics](https://climateainordics.com/) <img src="/images/cain-logo.png" alt="cain-logo" width="20px" style="vertical-align:middle;" /> -- Core team member of the [GEO](https://earthobservations.org/) AI4EO working group -- Affiliated with [CLIMES](https://www.climes.se/) -- Part of the [Computing within Limits](https://computingwithinlimits.org/2025/) community_

**Long version:** I'm a senior machine learning researcher at [RISE Research Institutes of Sweden](https://www.ri.se/sv/person/aleksis-pirinen) within the [_deep learning research group_](https://dl-group.se/), where my main research interest is to develop ML methods for a broad range of environmental applications (e.g. climate adaptation and humanitarian aid causes). I'm a co-founder of the research network [_Climate AI Nordics_](https://climateainordics.com/), am affiliated with the [Swedish Centre for Impacts of Climate Extremes (climes)](https://www.climes.se/), and am a core team member of the [GEO](https://earthobservations.org/) AI4EO working group.

If interested in my publications, please refer to [**this page**](https://aleksispi.github.io/publications/), and/or my [google scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=paBGTgsAAAAJ&hl=en). See [**this page**](https://aleksispi.github.io/projects/) for a selection of my past and ongoing projects. [**This page**](https://aleksispi.github.io/outreach/) lists a selection of invited talks as well as media and public communication. [**This page**](https://aleksispi.github.io/reviewing/) summarizes my honors, awards and review work.

Before joining [RISE](https://www.ri.se/en), I conducted my doctoral studies in computer vision at the [Faculty of Engineering, Lund University](https://www.lth.se/english/), under the supervision of [Prof. Cristian Sminchisescu](https://research.google/people/cristian-sminchisescu/). In my research, I applied deep reinforcement learning to computer vision tasks such as object detection and active vision, with the aim of making visual recognition systems more flexible and adaptive. I successfully defended my PhD thesis [_Reinforcement Learning for Active Visual Perception_](https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/6065e35e-b97b-44b8-97b0-a04fe3862a13) in June, 2021.

I'm an advocate for facing our difficult future (and present, for many), collectively and individually, so that we can try to reduce harm and suffering. I may write more about this under my [personal page](https://aleksispi.github.io/personal/) at some point, but for anyone interested in learning more about what is difficult about our future, I warmly recommend the podcasts [_The Great Simplification_](https://www.thegreatsimplification.com/), [_Breaking Down: Collapse_](https://collapsepod.buzzsprout.com/) (and the follow-up podcast [_Building Up: Resilience_](https://shows.acast.com/building-up-resilience)), [_Planet: Critical_](https://www.planetcritical.com/podcast), and [_Entangled World_](https://player.fm/series/entangled-world). Two other short and self-contained podcasts that I also recommend are [_Power: Limits and Prospects for Human Survival_](https://power.postcarbon.org/podcast/) and [_Tipping Point: The True Story of "The Limits to Growth"_](https://tippingpointstory.podigee.io/). I also try to summarize some reasons why in [this video](https://youtu.be/QXztQfKLiSc?si=zwTjXQ6Fw1t77f6s&t=1614).
