This page contains information about my past and ongoing master thesis supervision. My full professional bio can be found on the [main page](https://aleksispi.github.io).

**Spring 2024 (ongoing):** Co-main supervisor (jointly with [Martin Willbo](https://www.ri.se/sv/person/martin-willbo)) of the master thesis students Agnes Eriksson and Malte Åhman, Lund University. Academic supervisor: [Assoc. Prof. Mikael Nilsson](https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/mikael-nilsson-2). Thesis (preliminary title): _Privileged Learning Techniques for Improving Earth Observation-based Land Cover Mapping_.

**Spring 2024 (ongoing):** Co-main supervisor (jointly with [Dr. Olof Mogren](mogren.one)) of the master thesis students Emma Amnemyr and Daniel Björklund, Lund University. Academic supervisor: [Prof. Kalle Åström](https://www.maths.lu.se/staff/kalleastrom/). Thesis (preliminary title): _Active Learning for Improving Machine Learning-based Detection of Coffee Berry Disease_.  The thesis topic is within the area of climate adaptation and will be conducted with collaborators in Tanzania ([Mpendakazi Agribusiness](https://www.mpendakazi.co.tz/)), who provide data and use-cases.

**Summer-Fall 2023:** Co-main supervisor (jointly with [Dr. Olof Mogren](mogren.one)) of the master thesis students Axel Eiman and [Nils Eickhoff](https://nilseickhoff.com/), Chalmers University of Technology. Thesis: [_Weakly semi-supervised object detection for annotation efficiency: Leveraging a mix of strong bounding box labels and weak point labels for detecting coffee berry disease_](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KHbFBNb-sbOtXQdq2O7nk3l4NOOsPF49/view?usp=sharing). The thesis topic is within the area of climate adaptation and was conducted with collaborators in Tanzania ([Mpendakazi Agribusiness](https://www.mpendakazi.co.tz/)), who provided data and use-cases. A popular summary can be found [here](https://www.ri.se/en/what-we-do/projects/how-machine-learning-can-help-coffee-farmers-fight-disease).

**Spring 2023:** Main supervisor of the master thesis student Ennio Rampello, KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Academic supervisors: [Prof. Yifang Ban](https://www.kth.se/profile/yifang) and [Dr. Puzhao Zhang](https://www.kth.se/profile/puzhao). Thesis: [_High-altitude navigation to improve the performance of AiRLoc: An RL model for drone navigation_](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wg4znYHNi6AtMfpbGtPquu6ZcZEdMQjy/view?usp=sharing). The thesis is related to the area of UAV-based disaster response and management.

**Spring 2023:** Main supervisor of the master thesis student [Vishal Nedungadi](https://vishalned.github.io/), KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Academic supervisors: [Prof. Yifang Ban](https://www.kth.se/profile/yifang)  and [Ritu Yadav (PhD candidate)](https://www.kth.se/profile/rituy). Thesis: [_Active street to aerial view
geo-localization_](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pfz6ApZWeQm586MAjSNQct9BRN-QNTbi/view?usp=sharing). The thesis is related to the area of UAV-based disaster response and management.

**Spring 2022:** Main supervisor of the master thesis students Anton Samuelsson and John Backsund, Lund University. Academic supervisor: [Prof. Kalle Åström](https://www.maths.lu.se/staff/kalleastrom/). Thesis: [_Aerial View Goal Localization with Reinforcement Learning_](https://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&recordOId=9088977&fileOId=9089013). The thesis was subsequently condensed and accepted to a remote sensing workshop at ICLR 2023 (see _Publications and preprints_ above). The thesis is related to the area of UAV-based disaster response and management.
